# Virtual Assistant Lab
### A assistant that will be based on voice commands, designed, planned and made by [RRennix](https://github.com/RRennix).
The objective:
Open aplications, yeah, just it.

Now it can:
Search things that you asked for, and, of course, open aplications.

(More updates will come out soon)
